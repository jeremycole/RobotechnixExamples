/*
Drive the robot in a "box" pattern with right turns. This uses elapsed time
for both the turn and drive moves, so the TURN_TIME and DRIVE_TIME may need
to be adjusted to match the speed and agility of a particular robot. This was
tested with a direct-drive robot using NeveRest 40 motors and mecanum wheels
and makes a nearly perfect box within about 10 feet of space.

This OpMode uses empty while() loops to wait until the specified time has
elapsed, and uses an ElapsedTime object to count the passing of time.

Required hardware:
  1. Four motors should be connected to motor controllers and named for their
     position on the robot: "mFL", "mFR", "mBL", "mBR", where "F" means front,
     "B" means back, "R" means right, and "L" means left.
